This is a book of my favorite rounds, suitable for running off enough
copies for a singing party.

## User's notes

The asterisks indicate where to come in. The second voice should enter
when the first voice reaches the asterisk, and so on. When counting is
important (e.g. in Schickele's Dona Nobis), I've marked subsequent
entrances as well, so that the third voice should come in when the
second voice is at the first asterisk and the first voice is at the
second asterisk.

I tried to pitch the rounds where both everyone can sing them and
they're not too hard to read. In general I erred on the side of
pitching low; ranges typically lie in G4-D5. These pitches were not
very extensively tested.

## Project Structure

All the rounds live in one large Lilypond file, in alphabetical order.
See `book.ly` for more details.

## Compiling

The book can be built with a simple `lilypond book.ly` command.

## Dependencies

You will need a Lilypond version at least 2.14.2.
